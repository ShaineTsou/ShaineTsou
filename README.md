### Hi there 👋

I'm __Shaine Tsou__ based in Taiwan 🚀.
I'm a goal-oriented __front end developer__ with hands-on experience in __JavaScript(ES6+)__, __React__, __Gatsby__, __GraphQL__, __Python__ areas.

I have a great passion for programming 🔥. I really love solving challenging problems and creating software. I strive to learn and master web technologies as much as I can every day.
