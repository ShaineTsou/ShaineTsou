### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm __Shaine Tsou__ based in Taiwan.
I'm a goal-oriented __front end developer__ with hands-on experience in __JavaScript(ES6+)__, __React__, __Gatsby__, __GraphQL__, __Python__ areas.

I have a great passion for programming. I really love solving challenging problems and creating software. I strive to learn and master web technologies as much as I can every day.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-big-tech-faang-interviews/), [Advanced JavaScript Concepts](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-javascript-concepts/) and [20 JavaScript Web Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/)
